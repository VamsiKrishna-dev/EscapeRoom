# Escape Room Game
This is a command-line based Escape Room Game where you are locked in a room and must find the three-digit code to escape. You can interact with various objects in the room to gather clues about the code and escape the room in given attempts.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Escape Room Game! In this game, you will be locked in a mysterious room with no idea how you got there. The only way out is to find the secret code, but be careful, you have only 3 attempts to guess the code before the room is sealed forever. 

## How to Play
* You will have a limited number of attempts to guess the code.
* You can interact with various objects in the room to gather clues about the code.
* Type the number of the object you would like to interact with and then select option to either look, touch or sniff the object.
* Once you have gathered all the clues, use them to guess the 3 digit code and enter it.
* If you succeed, you win! Otherwise you lose after all attempts are over.
